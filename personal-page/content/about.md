## Education

I'm currently an Undergraduate student at the university of Nebraska-Lincoln. Club involvment includes [Aerospace Club](https://unlaero.space/) (division: [UAV IARC Team](https://unl-uav.github.io/) ) and eSAB (engineering student advisory board). The goal of the IARC team is to build an autonomous UAV to compete in the International Aerial Robotics Competition. The goal of eSAB is to facilitate a relationship between engineering students, engineering RSOs(recognized student orginization), and the college of engineering as a whole(faculty and staff).

## Research Interest

My research history shows that I'm interested in UAVs, this first began when I was in networking class at the career center in high school. With UAVs I've performed HRI studies and have helped advance the UAV IARC team. I believe that HRI research is important because autonomous systems are supposed to aid humans in many different challanges and domains. For the autonomous systems to do their designated actions, humans should be comfortable with them so that they can trust the autonomous system to perform correctly. HRI studies help autonomous sytem developers design systems so that humans are also comfortable with the system potentially minimizing safety risks. Although I've focused on HRI research, I would like to shift my focus to the bioinformatics domain. I've been involved with mBiTe which focuses on molecular and biochemical telecommunications. Here I began learning about some bioinformatics methods through the projects that I worked on. The goal of WetSpace is to  I would like to begin working on helping solve and do research on biological problems by appyling computer methods. 

## Work Experience

###### Recent Work

Currently working as a undergraduate researcher at [NIMBUS](https://nimbus.unl.edu/welcome) and [mBiTe](https://mbite.unl.edu/). At NIMBUS I work under Dr. Brittany Duncan. I do HRI studies using autonomous UAVs. With NIMBUS I have been able to expand my knowledge immensely. I've learned about ROS, SOLIDWORKS, AmazonMTURK, and ADOBE creative cloud. At mBiTe I work under Dr. Massimiliano Pierobon. With Dr. Pierobon, I work specifically on a project called WetSpace, a cybernetic platform for wet information systems space analysis. I also help maintain and develop [WetCoDe](http://wetcode.unl.edu/) and [PaRedox](http://paredox.unl.edu/). With the mBiTe lab I have learned about full stack development and wet communication systems.

###### Past Experience

My most recent position was a COVID drive-thru runner at Bryan Health. At Bryan, I worked with the drive-thru team to administer COVID-19 test and prepare them for transport to the lab for testing. I learned quickly use my hands to hold mutliple items with accuracy. Confirm information with RN and package test the correct way for transportation. I enjoyed working with the drive-thru team because they were all passionate and dedicated about helping the community.I've worked the both summers my freshman year, and sophmore year of college at MetroPCS in Miami, Florida. Here I got to practice my people skills and presentation skills as I was a sales associate. During these summers I was also able to gain a huge improvement in my skill of communicating with many different people. I worked at mutliple stores in many different parts of Miami, in some I was able to just speak english to the customers but in others, my spanish speaking skills were tested with a wide range of spanish speaking cultures. Here I also learned how to multi-task very well as I was usually handling many things at one time with a customer, whether it be making a bill payment and telling customers about our current ongoing promotions or even giving an entire family an upgrade and giving them new phones as a promotion for a port from another company.  In the past I've also worked as a crew member at Qdoba. Here I was able to learn how to work as part of a team. I had assigned duties every shift and also helped others while maintining those duties. I enjoyed working at Qdoba because it was very fast-paced, if I wasn't serving a customer then I was re-stocking the hot-box/fridge or prepping necessary things for the morning/afternoon shift. I also enjoyed being given a large list of things to accomplish for every shift, and challenging myself to get most of it done even if we were only expected to get it done on a very slow day.
